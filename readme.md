# Inner Battle
The Inner Battle is a game inspired by Elias Aslaksen's publication "The development of a believer". The game can be used as a fun activity during church collections, while simultaneously inspiring church members to engage with God's Word by sending "weapons" (Bible verses) in return for game credits. This can help younger members with little income to feel part of the collection even though they cannot contribute so much physically.

Important! The game is only a game, and can (and will) not be connected to any payment systems.


## To do
- [ ] Auto delete old games after certain time of inactivity
- [ ] playerSocketID can contain old data if disconnect was not registered. If this causes issues that people cannot login with their existig player details, consider creating a cleanup function which periodically scans the object and clears old data.
- [ ] Players can sometimes not click (onclick events not triggered). This typically happens after the server restarted.
